## üéØ Problem To Solve

Technical interview preparation often suffers from poor organization and lack of systematic review. When speaking with students these are the common pitfalls I found: 
- **Forgetting previously solved problems** due to lack of structured revision
- **Inefficient study patterns** without spaced repetition techniques
- **Poor progress tracking** across different algorithmic categories
- **Losing valuable notes and insights** from problem-solving sessions

This application aims to solve these challenges by implementing a **spaced repetition system** specifically designed to solidify DSA concepts through systematic review.
